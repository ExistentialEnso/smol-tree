# smol tree

Self-hosted app designed to replace centrally hosted link sharing services like Linktree with something that can be deployed and maintained by the end user themselves.

# How to Use

In the future, this may have more user-friendly features, but for now, fork the repo, edit the `linkconfg.json` file, and deploy to a Next.js host like Vercel. Configuration uses [Tailwind classes](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.
